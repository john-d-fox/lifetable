# **lifetable**: Create Standard Life Tables

The package contains a single function, `lifetable()`, for creating
standard life tables from age-specific mortality rates. Both single-year
and grouped (e.g., 5-year) life tables are supported.

Two data sets are included in the package:

- `CanadaMortality` contains 5-year age-specific mortality rates
for females and males in Canada in 2023 (with the first
two age groups 0 and 1--4).
- `CanadaMortalitySingleYear` contains single-year age-specific
mortality rates for females and males in Canada in the period
2021--2023.
